**TimeserverSource.js**

**Timeserver settings and the services it can provide.**

TimeserverSource.js defines all the services timeserver will provide.

Each service can be turned on by the corresponding env file parameters.

ServerTime is given from **getTimeServerTime**(), which is controlled by isLivetimeOn

in the env file. If IS_LIVETIME_ON is 1, then isLivetimeOn will be true, and **getTimeServerTime**() will return localtime. If not, then **getTimeServerTime**() will return a fake servertime, which can be set in env file.
